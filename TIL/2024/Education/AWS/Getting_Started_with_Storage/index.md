    - Choosing the right storage type

      - 1. Define your requirements

        - workload requirement
        - Security constraints
        - performance

      - 2. Review the storage option

    - Storage use case

      - Block
        - Hosting db
        - Big data analytics
        - Enterprise application
      - Object
        - Disaster recovery
        - Data lakes
        - Cloud-native applications

    - AWS core storage services
      - Elastic Block Store(EBS)
        - scalable, high-performance
        - for EC2
      - Elastic File System(EFS)
        - simple elastic file system
      - Simple Storage Service(S3)
